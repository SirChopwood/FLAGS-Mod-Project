Model by Pleasure

portablegen_low_01 - Default_BaseColor  			- Albedo Texture
portablegen_low_01 - Default_Emissive				- Emmisive Texture
portablegen_low_01 - Default_Normal				- Normal Texture
portablegen_low_01 - Default_OcclusionRoughnessMetallic		- Packed Texture (RED = Ambient Occlusion  GREEN = Roughness  BLUE = Metalness)

Remember to set the Default_OcclusionRoughnessMetallic's sRGB to OFF as seen in sRGB.JPG
Also Remember to set the Sampler Type to Linear Color for the Default_OcclusionRoughnessMetallic only ! (See sampler Type.JPG)
I have also included an example of the Texture Setup (See texture_setup.JPG)

The Model should be imported as Skeletal Mesh, because it consists of multiple parts, you can animate theroetically.

I will only offer limited support.

You can use this model for anything related to Satisfactory.
I don't need Credit, but ofc i would be happy to recieve it!

However :

DO NOT SELL THE MODEL!
DO NOT PRETEND THIS IS YOUR MODEL!

Enjoy !
