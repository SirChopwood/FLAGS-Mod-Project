# Functionally Lacking and Great Style
## Features

* Screen:
Like a wall-mounted TV, simple, but stylish

* Sci-Fi Screen:
Much the same, but with added future.

* Flag
It's a normal flag! It moves in the wind.

* Large Flag.
Bigger flag! Still moves in the wind.

* Banner Flag:
A flag. Sideways!

* Hanging Flag:
So you take a flag, break a bit of the pole off and throw that away, then you attach the rest to a wall.

* Circular Screen:
Ever been to a stadium or expo where there are these hanging circular signs? Cool right? Well this one rotates, too!
